# Rising World Plugin Template
For Rising World  "new version" / Unity Engine version. 
A simple template for making Rising World plugins.


### How to use:
1. You need [JDK 20](https://jdk.java.net/20/) since Rising World uses same Java version for plugins.
2. You need installed Rising World (Steam Version)
3. Clone this repo (with `git clone` or with downloading as .zip).
4. Change `pathToRisingWorld` variable in `build.gradle` to your Rising World root path (Unity version)
5. Change `group` variable in `build.gradle` if necessary, it should be equal to your main package name.
6. In `settings.gradle` change the name to your project label.
7. Edit `plugin.yml` and add your credits. You can change main class path (don't forget to create/move main class if you will do this)
8. Import project into your favourite IDE (IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse, Netbeans, etc.) and start making code

### Building plugin
If you are using IDE that has gradle integration you can just launch build task.
If your IDE don't have such features open a terminal or cmd utility and use command
`/gradlew build`.

Your plugin will appear in `/build/libs` folder with same name as specified in `settings.gradle`.
